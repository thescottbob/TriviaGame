# TriviaGame

Here is how this trivia game works. The user picks a category (Books, Movies, People, or Songs). Once they pick a category, all the categories dissapear and a series of questions relating to that category appears on the screen. These five multiple choice questions must be answered within 60 seconds. All portions of the game are coded or pseudocoded, and I expect to be done with the game by midnight on Friday (9/14).
