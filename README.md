# TriviaGame

All portions of the game are coded or pseudocoded, and I expect to be done with the game by midnight on Friday (9/14). Currently only the 'Movies' quiz is operational.

Here is how this trivia game works. The user picks a category (Books, Movies, People, or Songs). Once they pick a category, all the categories dissapear and a series of questions relating to that category appears on the screen. These four multiple choice questions must be answered within 60 seconds.
