# TriviaGame

All portions of the game are coded or pseudocoded. Currently only the 'Books' and 'Movies' quizzes are operational.

Here is how this trivia game works. The user picks a category (Books, Movies, People, or Songs). Once they pick a category, all the categories dissapear and a series of questions relating to that category appears on the screen. These four multiple choice questions must be answered within 30 seconds.
